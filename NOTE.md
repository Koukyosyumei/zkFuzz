### Progress

- LLVM IR can be used as an intermediate representation for analyzing Circom circuits.
- Fixed the existing [`circom2llvm`](https://github.com/Koukyosyumei/circom2llvm) compilier, compiler, though it still has many bugs.
- Modified `circom2llvm` to allow running the generated LLVM IR (.ll file) and obtaining the correct outputs.
- Explored the code of ZKAP, an implementation from [Wen, Hongbo, et al. "Practical Security Analysis of {Zero-Knowledge} Proof Circuits." 33rd USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 24). 2024.](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/presentation/wen). This tool leverages `circom2llvm`, and adds pattern-matching detection as an LLVM pass.
- Made ZKAP compatible with llvm-14, though it still crashes on certain circuits.
- Improved the visualization of the data-flow graphs generated by ZKAP.

### Progress

- Collected some actual under/over-constrained circuits

### TODO

- Explore the appropriate **intermediate representation** for Circom
- Identify the **free variables** in the programs
- Explore strategies for leveraging that information to improve the fuzzing process.
- Design a fuzzing approach that considers what can be statically analyzed, what should be dynamically executed, and how to provide effective **feedback** to guide the fuzzing.
