### TODO

- Explore the appropriate **intermediate representation** for Circom
- Identify the **free variables** in the programs
- Explore strategies for leveraging that information to improve the fuzzing process.
- Design a fuzzing approach that considers what can be statically analyzed, what should be dynamically executed, and how to provide effective **feedback** to guide the fuzzing.
